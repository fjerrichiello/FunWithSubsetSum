Write a program solving the subset sum problem using dynamic programming in C++
- Return the number of distinct subsets that yield a sum of T
- Return the size of the smallest subset yield T
- Return the number of distinct subsets yielding sum T and having the minimum size
- Report the lexicographically first minimum-size subset which yields the sum of T
